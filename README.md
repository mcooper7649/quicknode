At QuikNode, we value passion, progress, humility, trust and excellence. This is a three part
assignment, engineered with our company values and the skills youâ€™ll need to thrive as a
support engineer in mind.
What we're selecting for at this step is clarity of thought, ability to communicate and humility.
How clear is your writing? What are the items that you consider when working through a
customer issue? Are you willing to invest the time necessary to help us understand your
abilities?
We aim to be respectful of your time, this exercise should not take more than 30-40 minutes, but
feel free to take as much time as you need:

1. Given the following Ethereum address, please query the blockchain to get the latest
   balance of this account on Rinkeby, Ropsten, and Mainnet. You may use any command
   line tool or scripting language you choose. Please provide to us the commands or scripts
   that you use to get the balance, as well as the balance you get, and at what block
   number you have queried. (Hint: be resourceful, the endpoint in the screenshot is not a
   valid endpoint)
   a. Bonus points: describe your journey in completing this task, provide context with
   clear and concise written responses.

2. A customer is reporting that they were charged for a plan that they already canceled -
   what steps are you going to take to resolve this situation?
3. A customer is reporting that the service they signed up & paid for is not working for them
   (or not how they expect) - what steps are you going to take to resolve this situation?
